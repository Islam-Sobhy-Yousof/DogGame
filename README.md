# DogGame 🎲🐶

Welcome to DogGame! A fun two-player game where players take turns rolling the dice 🎲 and accumulating points. The goal is to be the first player to reach a total score of 100 or more.

## How to Play 🕹️

1. DogGame is a two-player game, with Player One going first.
2. On a player's turn, they roll a six-sided dice.
3. If the dice roll is not a one:
   - The current player's score increases by the value of the dice roll.
   - The player can choose to either roll again or hold.
4. If the dice roll is a one:
   - The current player's score resets to zero.
   - The turn passes to the other player.
5. To "hold":
   - The current player's current score is added to their total score.
   - The turn passes to the other player.
6. Players take turns rolling the dice and deciding whether to roll again or hold until one player reaches a total score of 100 or more.

## Additional Button 🔁

- There is an additional button available that resets the game. If any player presses it, the game will be reset, and scores will be cleared.
